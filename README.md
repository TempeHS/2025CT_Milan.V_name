# Project Title

Dungeon Duel 2P

## Description

This is a two-player fighting game made in Unity where each player controls a unique character with special abilities. The goal is to outsmart and defeat your opponent using timing, strategy, and your character’s powers. It’s designed for local multiplayer, so friends can battle it out side by side. The game features smooth controls, cool visuals, and a fun arena that keeps the action exciting. It’s a great showcase of Unity’s game-making tools and a solid base for adding more features like online play or new characters.
